# ChatBot

*A lab report by Wen-Ying(Rei) Lee*

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

The purpose of my chatbot, Chmath, is to help users excercise their brains with math questions! There will be totally 5 math questions for user to answer and, in the end, the chatbot will let user know how they perform! 
The first change I made is the background color of the chatbot, I made it to what I prefer, pink! The second change I did is adding a global variable, correctNum, to keep the track of how the performance of users for answering the quations. The variable will be used to distinguish different final result the user will get! Other than these, I just made changes to the questions to fit the purpose of my chatbot! 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
